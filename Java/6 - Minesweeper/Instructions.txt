Welcome to Minesweeper! The goal is to uncover all spaces on the grid as fast as possible without uncovering any of the mines. Left clicking a space will uncover it and if any spaces around it are armed with a mine, the selected space will display the number of surrounding mines. If there are no mines, the space will be blank. Any time a space is uncovered, all spaces around it with zero mines around them will also be uncovered. Since the score is how long it takes for all non-mine spaces to be uncovered, the aim to get as low a score as possible. If a mine is uncovered, all mines will be revealed and the game will end. If the player thinks they know where a mine is, the space can be flagged by right clicking the space (right clicking again will remove the flag). There are three difficulty levels: Easy (9 x 9 grid with 10 mines), Medium (16 x 16 grid with 40 mines), and Hard (20 x 20 grid with 70 mines). Once the game begins, the selected difficulty and time will be displayed above the grid. Good luck!
